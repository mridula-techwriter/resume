I am a single parent to a smart empathetic 10 yrs old and I also manage a doc team at work. This also means I champion organizational skills, time management, and prioritizations of tasks. It is important to share my status with you so that you can take an informed decision about hiring me.

At present I manage a team of fantastic five who make a world of difference at GreyOrange through their information development skills which includes and not limited to creating user manuals, release notes, installation guides, product demo videos and so on. As a content leader my vision is not only to create a team of great information developers, but also to nurture them into committed professionals who can keep discovering a better version of themselves with time.

As you explore this site you will get to know about the responsibilities in my present job as well as all the projects I have handled in the past.

## Trivia

I am a self trained artist with Kala Bisharad certification from Kolkata Lalit Kala Kendra. I love to conduct corporate trainings in meditative art forms like Zentangles.
